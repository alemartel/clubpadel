# Mobile-First League Management with Card UI

## Description
Transform the current table-based league management interface into a mobile-first card-based layout similar to the player teams view. This will improve usability on mobile devices and provide a more modern, touch-friendly interface for managing leagues and groups.

## Files to Modify

### UI Components
- `ui/src/pages/AdminLeagues.tsx` - Replace table layout with responsive card grid
- `ui/src/pages/AdminGroups.tsx` - Replace table layout with responsive card grid  
- `ui/src/components/ui/card.tsx` - No changes needed (already supports mobile-first design)

### New Components (if needed)
- `ui/src/components/LeagueCard.tsx` - Reusable league card component
- `ui/src/components/GroupCard.tsx` - Reusable group card component

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: League Management Cards
Replace the table in `AdminLeagues.tsx` with a responsive card grid:

**Current Table Structure:**
- Table with columns: Name, Start Date, End Date, Actions
- Actions include: Groups, Edit, Delete buttons

**New Card Structure:**
- Responsive grid: `grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Each card displays:
  - League name as card title
  - Start/end dates with calendar icons
  - Action buttons in card footer
  - Hover effects for better UX

**Card Layout Algorithm:**
1. Use existing `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter` components
2. Display league name prominently in header
3. Show date range in content with `Calendar` icons
4. Place action buttons in footer with proper spacing
5. Add hover effects: `hover:shadow-md transition-shadow`
6. Ensure touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px touch targets)

### Phase 2: Group Management Cards  
Apply same card pattern to `AdminGroups.tsx`:

**Current Table Structure:**
- Table with columns: Name, Level, Gender, Actions
- Actions include: Edit, Delete buttons

**New Card Structure:**
- Same responsive grid pattern
- Each card displays:
  - Group name as card title
  - Level and gender as badges (similar to MyTeams pattern)
  - Action buttons in card footer

**Card Layout Algorithm:**
1. Reuse card component structure from Phase 1
2. Display group name in header
3. Show level and gender as badges in content area
4. Use existing badge variants from MyTeams (`getLevelBadgeVariant`, `getGenderBadgeVariant`)
5. Place action buttons in footer

### Phase 3: Mobile Optimization
Enhance mobile experience with touch-friendly interactions:

**Mobile-Specific Features:**
1. Larger touch targets for action buttons
2. Swipe gestures for quick actions (optional enhancement)
3. Optimized spacing for thumb navigation
4. Full-width cards on mobile (`sm:grid-cols-1`)

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Tablet (md): Two column layout  
- Desktop (lg+): Three column layout

### Phase 4: Consistent Styling
Ensure visual consistency with existing MyTeams card design:

**Styling Patterns:**
1. Use same card hover effects: `hover:shadow-md transition-shadow`
2. Consistent badge styling and variants
3. Same icon usage patterns (Calendar, Users, etc.)
4. Matching button styles and spacing
5. Consistent typography hierarchy

## Technical Considerations

### Responsive Design
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`
- Implement mobile-first approach (base styles for mobile, then enhance for larger screens)
- Ensure proper touch target sizes (minimum 44px)

### State Management
- No changes to existing state management
- Reuse existing API calls and data structures
- Maintain existing form dialogs and modals

### Accessibility
- Maintain proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Ensure keyboard navigation works with card layout
- Preserve screen reader compatibility

### Performance
- No performance impact expected
- Cards render efficiently with existing data
- No additional API calls required

## Dependencies
- Existing ShadCN card components
- Current responsive design system
- Existing icon library (Lucide React)
- Current authentication and admin role system

## Notes
- This is a pure UI/UX enhancement with no backend changes required
- The card layout will be more touch-friendly than the current table interface
- Visual consistency with MyTeams page will improve overall user experience
- Mobile users will benefit significantly from the improved interface
